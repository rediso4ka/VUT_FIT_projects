## Installation
To run the code from `lib` folder you would need to create a project using Android Studio.
Then you could use either Android Studio or VS Code to build and run the project through emulator.

## Libraries
The libraries (or plugins specifically) that we have used can be found in `pubspec.yaml` file, which is used by Flutter projects to specify dependencies.
