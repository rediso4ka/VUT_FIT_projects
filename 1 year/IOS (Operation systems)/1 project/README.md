Coronavirus statistics in Czech Republic.

## Usage:
``` terminal
    ./corona -h                     (to see all opportunities)
    ./corona infected ./Tests/osoby2.csv
    ./corona infected infected-jan22/2022-01-*.csv
    ./corona countries ./Tetst/osoby2.csv
    ./corona -s monthly ./Tests/osoby2.csv
```

P.S. I have no message for bad entry and did not make "kraje" and "okresy"
