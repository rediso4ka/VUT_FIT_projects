Working with processes, using semaphores. Oxygen and hydrogen creating molecule of water. Order of arguments: number of oxygen atoms, number of hydrogen atoms, atom time to sleep (ms), molecule time to sleep (ms).

## Usage:
``` terminal
    make
    ./proj2 5 10 100 100 ; cat proj2.out
    ./proj2 5 11 100 100 ; cat proj2.out        (for not ideal situation)
    ./proj2 10000 20000 100 100                 (works fine, but proj2.out has 120.000 rows)
```
