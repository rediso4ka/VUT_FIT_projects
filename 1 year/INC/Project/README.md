# INC project: shortly

UART (Universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter) - receiver part implementation in VHDL.


P.S. The project had 2 parts:
1) creating a scheme and FSM,
2) VHDL implementation and improving part 1).  

So at first the 1) part was actually bad, and I received minimum points, but now it's improved to 13/15 points :D
